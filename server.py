# The arguments to select() are three lists containing communication channels
# to monitor. The first is a list of the objects to be checked for incoming
# data to be read, the second contains objects that will receive outgoing data
# when there is room in their buffer, and the third those that may have an
# error (usually a combination of the input and output channel objects). The
# next step in the server is to set up the lists containing input sources and
# output destinations to be passed to select().

# Sockets from which we expect to read
inputs = [ server ]

# Sockets to which we expect to write
outputs = [ ]

# Connections are added to and removed from these lists by the server main
# loop. Since this version of the server is going to wait for a socket to
# become writable before sending any data (instead of immediately sending the
# reply), each output connection needs a queue to act as a buffer for the data
# to be sent through it.

# Outgoing message queues (socket:Queue)
message_queues = {}

# The main portion of the server program loops, calling select() to block and
# wait for network activity.

# lists passed in. All of the sockets in the readable list have incoming data
# buffered and available to be read. All of the sockets in the writable list
# have free space in their buffer and can be written to. The sockets returned
# in exceptional have had an error (the actual definition of “exceptional
# condition” depends on the platform).

# The “readable” sockets represent three possible cases. If the socket is the
# main “server” socket, the one being used to listen for connections, then the
# “readable” condition means it is ready to accept another incoming connection.
# In addition to adding the new connection to the list of inputs to monitor,
# this section sets the client socket to not block.
